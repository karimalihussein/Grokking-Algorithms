Selection Sort [
    - Simple Sorting Algorithm.
    - In Place Algorithm.   
]

1 - Let's Put it all together to lrarn your secound algorithm: selection sort to follow this section,
you need to understand arrays and list as well as big O Notation.


For Example:
Suppose you want sort array of numbers from smallest number to largest number.

$list = [
    2,
    8,
    5,
    3,
    9,
    4,
    1
];

if i make swipe with every little number as like 2 make swipe with 1 and 8 mmake swipe with 2 etc..

this takes O(n*n) time or o(n2) time sorting algorithms are very useful 
now you can sort
- Namesin Phone Book
- Travel Dates
- Emails (newest to oldest)


Sorting Algorithms [
    - Max
    - Min
    - Search
    - Find Duplicate Elements
]

Another Example:
$array2  = [
    0 => 60,
    1 => 40,
    2 => 50,
    3 => 30,
    4 => 10,
    5 => 20
];

Ascending Order:min
Descending order:max

$min = first element $array2[0] // 60;

i will make if condition to compare with $min with $i in for loop like this:

for ($i = 1; $x <= count($this->array); $x++) {
    $min = $i;
  
}
